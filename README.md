## Run All Services Using `docker-compose`

1. Copy the .env file from the email to the base folder of each service (`analysis-service` and `jobs-creator-service`).
2. Navigate to the directory that contains the `docker-compose.yml` file in your terminal.
3. Run `docker-compose build` to build the services.
4. Run `docker-compose up` to start the services. Add `-d` to the end of the command to run the services in detached mode.
